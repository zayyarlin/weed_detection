## Project Description

In this project, we will build a convolutional neural network from scratch, using only numpy for matrix operations and numba for high performance Python, to classify the weed dataset. We will then compare against the state of the art result described below.

## Prior work

Ferreira et al, demonstrated 99% accuracy on the weed dataset with a Convolutional Neural Networks trained using CaffeNet architecture, which is a replication of AlexNet architecture.
